# TVShow

TVShow application is a web application for categorizing, searching, and showing information about TV shows. 
This was written by using the Vue 3 framework with the Vuetify UI framework and Pinia state management.

Vuetify UI framework was chosen as it supports many UI components that were used in the TVShow application. This framework is easy to configure with Vue 3 and is considered one of the most recommended framework for Vue 3. 

Pinia state management is the recommended state management in the Vue documentation. 

The Vitest test framework is used for writing unit tests and the Cypress test framework is used for E2E tests which are the recommended in Vue documentation.
